# InteroceptionHEP

- HEP is objective marker of altered bodily awareness (Terhaar, et al., 2012)
-	Systole is associated with low perceptual sensitivity and leads to longer touch in tactile grating orientation task: duration of touch depends on timing in cardiac cycle. Touches initiated in systole were held longer; touches in diastole shorter. In control condition, no such effect. (Galvez-Pol, et al., 2022)  
-	HEP higher during interoception than during exteroception (Petzschner, et al., 2018)
-	Good heartbeat perceivers had a higher effect of attention state on HEP than bad heartbeat perceivers (Yuan, et al., 2007)


Depression and emotions: 
-	Emotions can change HEP (Couto, et al., 2015) 
-	HEP reduced in depressed patients (Terhaar, et al., 2012)
